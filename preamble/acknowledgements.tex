This thesis is the culmination of the first few years of my academic journey.
However, I have been afforded the want and resilience to get to this point by a
great many people. Here, I would like to acknowledge a non-exhaustive list of
those people.

First and most importantly, I offer my utmost gratitude to my supervisors, Dr
Jonathan Gillard and Dr Vincent Knight. Your support, encouragement, and
guidance throughout this project have been invaluable. You have made a great
team for me, and your distinct brand of tutelage has instilled in me equal
measures of curiosity, determination, and scepticism. I would also like to thank
Mr Kendal Smith and those at Cwm Taf Morgannwg for allowing me to work on a
project that has inspired great motivation and intrigue for me.

I offer my thanks to my family, who have been a source of inspiration and
support during my studies. Thank you to my parents, Susan and John, who have
always pushed me to exceed myself. Thank you to my siblings for facilitating a
healthy amount of competition growing up. Finally, I offer a special thanks to
my older brother, Matthew, for looking out for me when I have needed it most.

To my dearest friends, Noah Atkin, Jessica Lockwood, Cameron Pearson, and Edward
Priest, I offer my sincere thanks and admiration. Your unwavering kindness,
warmth, and solace have been vital to keeping my head above water at the worst
of times and has filled me with a great sense of joy otherwise.

Finally, I turn my attention to my academic home for the last six or so years,
Cardiff University. I wish to thank my peers in the School of Mathematics,
especially Emma Aspland, Lorenzo De Biase, Nikoleta Glynatsi, Emily Oâ€™Riordan,
Geraint Palmer, Chris Seaman, and \'{A}lvaro Torras Casas, for your stimulating
conversation, resolute solidarity and welcomed distraction. Lastly, thank you to
the School of Mathematics staff for maintaining a nourishing environment in
which to study and work.
