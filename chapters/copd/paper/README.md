A repository to accompany the paper investigating COPD patients' interactions with the Cwm Taf region's hospital system.

> Data-driven research in healthcare settings is paramount. This work
investigates a population of COPD patients in the South Wales area and
encompasses the topics of segmentation analysis, queuing modelling, and the
recovery of queuing parameters from incomplete data. This is done despite
common limitations in operational research with regard to the availability
of fine-grained data as this work only uses administrative hospital spell
data from those patients.
