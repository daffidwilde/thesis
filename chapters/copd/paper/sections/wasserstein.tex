\section{Estimating queuing parameters}\label{sec:wasserstein}

Reiterate the objective of the paper --- to model a COPD ward within a hospital
--- and draw attention to lack of fine-grain data. Lead into how this can be
overcome with the Wasserstein distance (a lot of this has been written up in
\texttt{nbs/wasserstein.ipynb}). A brief summary of how the parameter set is
chosen and a nice image of the queue we are building. Close out the section with
best and worst case parameter set plots.
