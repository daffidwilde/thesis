\Begin{%
    collate the columns and metadata from each parent in a pool\;
    sample each dimension from between the parents uniformly\;
    form an empty dataset with these dimensions\;
    \For{each column in the dataset}{%
        sample a column (and its corresponding metadata) from the pool\;
        \If{this column is longer than required}{%
            randomly select entries and delete them as needed

            sample new values from the metadata and append them to the column as
            needed
        }
        add this column to the dataset and record its metadata\;
