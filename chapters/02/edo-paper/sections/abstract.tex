\begin{abstract}
    In this paper we propose a new method for learning how algorithms perform.
    Classically, algorithms are compared on a finite number of existing (or
    newly simulated) benchmark data sets based on some fixed metrics. The
    algorithm(s) with the smallest value of this metric are chosen to be the
    `best performing'.

    We offer a new approach to flip this paradigm. We instead aim to gain a
    richer picture of the performance of an algorithm by generating artificial
    data through genetic evolution, the purpose of which is to create
    populations of datasets for which a particular algorithm performs well.
    These data sets can be studied to learn as to what attributes lead to a
    particular progress of a given algorithm.

    Following a detailed description of the algorithm as well as a brief
    description of an open source implementation, a number of numeric
    experiments are presented to show the performance of the method which we
    call Evolutionary Dataset Optimisation.
