# Understanding the factors which lead to cost variability within the NHS
A private repo for my thesis at Cardiff University with the Cwm Taf University Health Board

This work can be separated into three (mostly non-chronological) parts:
1. The mining and analysis of big data using established and "new" algorithms
2. Building game- and queueing-theoretic models to reflect those factors which most affect variations in cost
3. Utilising statistics to convey findings to management within the health board and to assess variations
