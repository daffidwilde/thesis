\section{Taking a slice: diabetic patient analysis}

    \textbf{Too wordy?}
    Given some slice of the data, we want to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Examine cost variations and general surface-level statistics
        \item Determine components and variable relationships of interest
        \item Consider the relative `cost' of the patients in this slice
        \item Contrast this against its complement and the general dataset
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    This is a known area of interest to the health board.

    \vspace{10pt}
    Diabetic patients make up 10.8\% of all the episodes in the dataset, and
    roughly 8.7\% of the unique patients in the dataset.

    \vspace{10pt}
    Here we consider patients to be `diabetic' if they have diabetes flagged as
    either a primary or secondary condition in their episode.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Relative resource consumption by diabetic patients is consistent
        \item Cost components are less variant than \-- and are comparable in
            their distribution to \-- non-diabetic patients
    \end{itemize}
