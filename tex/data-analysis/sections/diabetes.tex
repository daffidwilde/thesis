\section{Taking a slice: diabetic patient analysis}\label{sec:diabetes}

The main conclusion from Section~\ref{sec:overview} is that the dataset being
worked with contains a low of skew. As such, it is in the interest of the
research to consider subsets, or slices, of the data. The hope of which is to
reduce the amount of internal variation caused by trying to observe and
investigate the costs of a huge variety of patients. In this section, the focus
will be on diabetic patients. As will be seen, the diabetic population is
increasing in the Cwm Taf area, making it an area of interest to the Health
Board aside from this project.
