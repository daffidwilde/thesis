\section{Taking a slice: diabetic patient analysis}\label{sec:diabetes}

The main conclusion to be taken away from the previous summative analysis is
that the dataset contains a huge amount of variation. Therefore, in order to
conduct more meaningful analysis, more homogenous subsets of the data must be
considered.

Classically, patients are categorised by age or condition. However, it has been
shown that doing so often gives an unrepresentative slice of
patients~\cite{Vuik2016}. In this section, the focus will be on the diabetic
population within the dataset despite this potential danger as it provides a
good example of condition-based slicing and is of interest to public health
groups.

Since diabetes is recorded only as a primary or secondary condition in the
dataset and is not distinguished by type, the diabetic population is considered
to be any instance where diabetes is present.

The ensuing analysis will provide evidence that the diabetic population is
increasing in the Cwm Taf area, and that, despite this, the relative resource
consumption by diabetic patients has been stagnant over the data period. It will
also be seen that this population holds too much variation to make meaningful 
conclusions about the population on the whole. However, by considering a subset
based on a condition such as this, there is a natural opportunity to compare
the subset with its complement; by considering the differences and similarities
between these two datasets a new dimension is added to the analysis.


\subsection{Distributions and summative statistics}%
\label{subsec:diabetes_distributions_statistics}

In much the same way as in Section~\ref{subsec:distributions_statistics}, taking
an overview of the key attributes provides some idea about how costs are
represented in the data.
Figures~\ref{fig:diabetes_no_spells_bar}~\--~\ref{fig:diabetes_netcost_kde} show
the same statistics as in the summative analysis though these figures have two
additional components: (a) in the case of bar charts, separate plots for overall
frequency and frequency density, and (b) a comparison with the non-diabetic
population on the same axes.

\subsection{Pairwise correlation}\label{subsec:diabetes_correlation}

With an overview of how the key attributes are distributed in mind, as before,
it is a good idea to see how these attributes interact with one another. In
Figure~\ref{fig:diabetes_corr_heatmap}, the Pearson correlation coefficients
are shown between each of the pairs of the key attributes in the diabetic
population. Again, the attributes have been ranked in descending order according
to their summed absolute correlation coefficient (see
Definition~\ref{def:absolute_correlation}) to determine those with the highest
levels of interaction.
