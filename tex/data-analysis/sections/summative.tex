As was discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:structure}, the vast majority of our
attributes will not be considered at this stage of our analysis so we can focus
on how the cost of care is distributed and seen in the data. The exclusion of
these attributes does not, however, imply that they are not of interest. 

\subsection{Distributions and summative
statistics}\label{subsec:distributions_statistics}
\graphicspath{{./img/general/}}

When we look at the distributions of our subset of attributes on the whole
dataset we see that the data is skewed towards low-cost, short-stay, and
otherwise low-impact patients with long, heavy tails, as seen in
Figures~\ref{fig:netcost_kde}~\--~\ref{fig:no_spells_hist}. We can then take
advantage of the other attributes to identify slices of the dataset which are of
interest by literature review, clustering, or otherwise.

In the following plots, and subsequently, when we refer to `spell-level'
quantities, we mean that each of our cost components and the number of
procedures are summed over all episodes in any given spell, the number of
diagnoses at the spell level is considered as the maximal number of diagnoses in
a spell, and the length of stay is unique to the spell not the episode. The
decision to take the maximal number of diagnoses as opposed to the total number
of diagnoses is justified since, (a.) we want to minimise the effect of counting
the same diagnosis more than once at the spell level, and (b.) the severity of a
patient's condition is often compared against their Charlson comorbidity
index~(CCI), which a weighted summation of their individual
severities~\cite{Thygesen2011}. As such, by taking the maximum number of
diagnoses we hope to capture the most severe a patient's condition becomes
during a spell as this is often indicative of how aggressive the patient's
treatments are, and thus likely more expensive due to additional drug or ward
costs, for instance.

As can clearly be seen, the dataset has some significant skew. In particular,
the average lengths and total number of stays for patients are low
(Figures~\ref{fig:los_hist}~\&~\ref{fig:no_spells_hist} respectively). A
corollary to be drawn from these plots is that it seems that of all the spells
in hospital provided under the health board, the majority of them are daycases
and one-off treatments.

However, this does not imply that these spells all come cheap. When we look at
the distribution of the net cost of a spell (Figure~\ref{fig:netcost_kde}) we
see that although there is a distinct peak around a relatively low net cost,
this value has probability \(7.5\times10^{-4}\ (2 sf.)\). That is, the most
likely net cost of treating a patient in this dataset occurs less than one tenth
of a percent of the time, and the overwhelming majority of recorded net costs
are spread over a massive range. While tests do exist for verifying if our
empirical data is truly heavy-tailed~\cite{Bryson1974}, it is clear our net
costs (at least) are distributed in such a way. Further results on the
distributions of our net and component costs can be seen in
Table~\ref{tab:summative}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
        \input{./tex/summative_stats0.tex}
    }
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
        \input{./tex/summative_stats1.tex}

    }
    \caption{Summative spell-level statistics for each of our non-trivial cost
    components and our selected clinical variables.}\label{tab:summative}
\end{table}

There are methods available to attempt to overcome this skewedness, including
the scaling and transformation of our numerical attributes, but they are not
necessary for the purposes of a summative analysis, though this process could
improve the performance of several algorithms on the dataset since it is of
mixed type. Moreover, the presence of this skewedness in some attributes is not
to say that all the attributes are so harshly skewed; for instance,
Figure~\ref{fig:age_hist} shows the clear peaks and troughs in the distribution
of the ages of our patients. It is clear that the distribution of ages does not
have a bell-shaped curve and should likely not be modelled as normally
distributed \-- or otherwise `bell-shaped', for that matter.

\subsection{Pairwise correlation}\label{subsec:corr}

Figure~\ref{fig:corr_heatmap} shows the Pearson correlation coefficient of all
pairs in our subset of selected attributes (not including age or number of
spells) in the form of a heatmap with a colour bar is located to the right of
it. Using a visual aid such as this makes gaining insight from our array of
numbers, and thus the relationships between our variables, much easier than
studying a table or matrix directly. It should also be noted that these
attributes are considered at the spell level again.
