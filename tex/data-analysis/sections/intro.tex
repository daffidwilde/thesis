\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

In this work a summative and exploratory analysis of a patient-episode dataset
will be conducted. This dataset has been provided by the Cwm Taf University
Health Board and details the costs associated with treating patients during
their time in hospital. The focus of this analysis is to better understand and
observe variation in these costs; in particualar, how a selection of key,
cost-related attributes are distributed across the entire dataset and how
they interact with one another. These attributes are comprised of non-trivial
cost components and a set of clinical attributes typically associated with
changes in costs. The ensuing analysis will show that while the bulk of this data
corresponds to short-stay and relatively low-cost and -impact spells of
treatment, there are long, heavy tails with high levels of variation.
        
Following this, a framework for the analysis of slices within the data is
established, using the diabetic population as an example. This framework
provides another dimension to the overall analysis through the use of comparison
and contrast but the intended impact is ultimately lost due, again, to high
levels of variation. Finally, we look toward other methods
for partioning the data and identifying intrinsic structures within. These
methods are based in the clustering of patients and spells specifically so the
framework is still applicable. There is also discussion of the clustering of
patient pathways and how such analysis could highlight areas, procedures or
departments that influence variation more strongly.

However, before any analysis can be conducted it is best to learn how the data
is structured and how it has been prepared.

\subsection{Data structure}\label{subsec:structure}

The data is comprised of approximately two and a half million episode
records for patients from across Wales that were treated in the Prince
Charles and Royal Glamorgan hospitals (South Wales) from April 2012 through to
April 2017. The geographic distribution of the patients is given in
Figure~\ref{fig:proportion_wales}.

\end{figure}

An episode is defined to be any continuous period of care provided
by the same consultant in the same place. For instance, if a patient is admitted
to a general medical ward for diagnosis and testing, and then is referred to a
specialist consultant in oncology, then their first episode would end with their
testing, and a second episode of care would begin on the oncology ward. Each of
these episodes would correspond to a row in the dataset. If the patient was then
discharged, they would have completed a spell with two episodes.

In this analysis, looking at episode-level statistics will be avoided in favour
of a patient's spell-level statistics. Since the introduction of the `payment by
results' system for financial flows, it has been seen that focusing on the more
granular episode statistics can lead to the amount of resource or `activity'
consumed by a hospital to treat that patient being overestimated~\cite{BMJ2004}.

Each episode is recorded as a row of roughly 260 attributes or columns,
including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Personal information such as identification numbers, age, registered
        GP practice;
    \item Other clinical quantities such as the number of diagnoses and
        procedures conducted in that episode, admission and discharge dates and
        methods, and length of stay;
    \item A number of cost components which include the costs coming from
        various departments within the hospital, overall medical and ward costs,
        as well as overhead costs;
    \item Diagnosis (HRG, ICD-10) and procedure (OPCS-4) codes, as well as
        Charlson index scores for the appropriate chronic diseases.
\end{itemize}

Of the attributes listed here, the focus is on the total, net and component
costs, and a selection of other clinical variables \-- paying particular
attention to those attributes which are considered to be linked to an overall
contribution to the cost of care. Those attributes are: length of stay, the
maximum number of diagnoses during a spell, the total number of procedures
during a spell, and (separately) the number of spells associated with any given
patient.

These attributes provide a base for understanding how the costs and resources
consumed by a patient in a spell are built up: cost components give direct
evidence for departments and types of procedure; length of stay gives an
indication of the nature of the spell and any default costs that are incurred;
considering the maximum and total number of diagnoses and procedures
(respectively) in a spell will allow for some understanding of the severity or
complexity of a patient's spell in hospital.

\subsection{Cleaning the data}\label{subsec:formatting}

As with any real-world data analysis, a substantial amount of preprocessing and
formatting was required to make the data consistent and suitable for our
purposes. This process included the removal of some superfluous columns which
added unwanted redundancy to the dataset, and a number of rows that had been
corrupted by some external storage software prior to this work's beginning. In
addition to this, some columns have been reformatted; namely those whose entries
were intended to be used as datetime objects later on. These include admission
and discharge dates, and financial bench periods.
