\chapter{Automatic final-year project allocation in a School of Biosciences}
\label{app:biosci}

\section{Introduction}

For many undergraduate students, a crucial part of their degree is their
final-year project (FYP). This piece of work characterises their interests and
allows the student to demonstrate their command of a chosen subject. Being
assigned a favourable FYP topic is of great importance. Good allocation affects
the student experience, improving student-supervisor relationships, engagement,
and, eventually, satisfaction~\cite{Briffa2018,Kuh2009}.

However, as the ratio between students and university staff
increases~\cite{McDonald2013}, so does the need for fair and efficient FYP
allocation systems. This need is both logistical and pedagogic. Logistical in
that as cohort sizes increase, the demands on administrative staff grow, meaning
manual systems eventually become infeasible. Pedagogical, given the impacts of
good project allocation on learning.

FYP allocation is a resource allocation problem with a specific set of
constraints. Typically, these correspond to student preferences, supervisor
preferences, and workload capacities. This appendix uses the student-project
allocation problem (SA) introduced in Appendix~\ref{app:matching} to model FYP
allocation in the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University (BIOSI).
Implementing the allocation as an instance of SA grants access to an algorithm
which produces a unique, student-optimal, mathematically fair allocation. In
doing so, the work hours required by the staff are reduced dramatically.

The remainder of this appendix is set out as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Section~\ref{sec:matching} presents a summary of the \matching\
        library and its use
    \item Section~\ref{sec:biosi} comprises a case study for BIOSI
    \item Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} summarises the manuscript and potential
        further problems
\end{itemize}
